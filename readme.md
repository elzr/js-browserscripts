JS browserscripts
===================

Simple scripts to extract plain-text or manipulate text from websites:

* **amazon-media-details.js**: Extract media details from Amazon (US & international). 
* **quoting.js**: Cite selected text by textile formatting it, properly indenting it, and embedding the website's metadata.
* **spacing.js**: Experiment.

They all load jQuery if not present.

I use them with the [**Shortcut Manager** Chrome extesion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortcut-manager/mgjjeipcdnnjhgodgjpfkffcejoljijf?hl=en) which allows me to trigger them on any website via a keyboard shortcut. Very handy.

Executed from here in Github so that they're synched across my computers.
